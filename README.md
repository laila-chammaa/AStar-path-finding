An implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the optimal path between two points in a 2D grid. 

Looked at pseudo-code, and then wrote the algorithm in JavaScript using the p5.js library for rendering.

Adding obstacles (walls) to the grid as well as functionality for moving diagonally.

The algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
